Lambda Webapp Exercise
======================

Write a basic webapp using your choice of Python or JavaScript in Lambda that displays static information using HTML, CSS and JS.

Next, augment your webapp to show some dynamic information based on queryStringParameters that can be provided by a form in the webapp.
Information can be in S3, DynamoDB or an API. 

Finally, augment your webapp to allow the user to take some action via a POST request.
It should do something like store information in DynamoDB, send a message to SQS or publish a message to SNS.
